## Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ansel, and I'm a junior in Computer Science at Georgia Tech! 

ðŸ”­ My interests are in backend programming, distributed computing, machine learning, system simulation, and data operations, and I have featured a multitude of projects across those domains on my public portfolio.

Most recently, I spent the summer of 2024 interning at Travelers Insurance, managing data pipelines and infrastructure supporting analytical dashboards and machine learning. I've also been working with the Georgia Tech Systems Infrastructure and Architecture Lab since Spring. âš¡

 ðŸ“« The best place to reach me is via my LinkedIn, www.linkedin.com/in/ansel-erol.
