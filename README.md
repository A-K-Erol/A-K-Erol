## Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ansel, and I'm a BS/MS Computer Science student at Georgia Tech! 

ðŸ”­ I'm interested in the challenges of deploying real-time, high-throughput software systems at scale - for analytical, machine learning, and transaction processing workloads. I have featured a multitude of projects across those domains on my public portfolio.

My experience includes software engineering at Google (private ML ad infra), Travelers Insurance (data operations) and research in Distributed Machine Learning, Operations Research/Optimization, and Natural Language Processing.
